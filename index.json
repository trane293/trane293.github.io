I received a full scholarship to pursue my masters degree at SFU along with a special entrance scholarship. I later became an NSERC-CREATE Bioinformatics Fellow for the year 2018-2019 under the joint Bioinformatics Program between UBC-SFU.\nMy main interests lie in machine learning and deep learning, specifically for application towards medical imaging [1], [2], [3], computer vision [4], and natural language processing [5], [6]. I have hands on experience with a variety of different projects in both industry and academia, where I developed computer vision systems for autonomous cars [7], computer aided detection systems for mammography [3], [8] and brain MRI [9], handwritten signature verification system [10], and applied reinforcement learning algorithms to computer animation [11].

The ability to visualize tissue in varied contrasts in the form of MR pulse sequences in a single scan provides valuable insights to physicians, as well as enabling automated systems performing downstream analysis. However many issues like prohibitive scan time, image corruption, different acquisition protocols, or allergies to certain contrast materials may hinder the process of acquiring multiple sequences for a patient. This poses challenges to both physicians and automated systems since complementary information provided by the missing sequences is lost. In this paper, we propose a variant of generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of leveraging redundant information contained within multiple available sequences in order to generate one or more missing sequences for a patient scan. The proposed network is designed as a multi-input, multi-output network which combines information from all the available pulse sequences, implicitly infers which sequences are missing, and synthesizes the missing ones in a single forward pass. We demonstrate and validate our method on two brain MRI datasets each with four sequences, and show the applicability of the proposed method in simultaneously synthesizing all missing sequences in any possible scenario where either one, two, or three of the four sequences may be missing. We compare our approach with competing unimodal and multi-modal methods, and show that we outperform both quantitatively and qualitatively.","tags":["mri","deep learning","generative adversarial networks","medical image analysis","computer vision"],"title":"Missing MRI Pulse Sequence Synthesis using Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Cardoen","Hanene Ben Yedder","Anmol Sharma","Keng C Chou","Ivan Robert Nabi","Ghassan Hamarneh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577232000,"objectID":"7f0d4f05a9fb8fc8293008362388a988","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/publication/ergo_tmi/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ergo_tmi/","section":"publication","summary":"Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows unprecedented insight into the three-dimensional organization of proteins at the nanometer scale. The combination of minimal invasive cell imaging with high resolution positions SMLM at the forefront of scientific discovery in cancer, infectious, and degenerative diseases. By stochastic temporal and spatial separation of light emissions from fluorescent labelled proteins, SMLM is capable of nanometer scale reconstruction of cellular structures. Precise localization of proteins in 3D astigmatic SMLM is dependent on parameter sensitive preprocessing steps to select regions of interest. With SMLM acquisition highly variable over time, it is non-trivial to find an optimal static parameter configuration. The high emitter density required for reconstruction of complex protein structures can compromise accuracy and introduce artifacts. To address these problems, we introduce two modular auto-tuning pre-processing methods: adaptive signal detection and learned recurrent signal density estimation that can leverage the information stored in the sequence of frames that compose the SMLM acquisition process. We show empirically that our contributions improve accuracy, precision and recall with respect to the state of the art. Both modules auto-tune their hyper-parameters to reduce the parameter space for practitioners, improve robustness and reproducibility, and are validated on a reference in silico dataset. Adaptive signal detection and density prediction can offer a practitioner, in addition to informed localization, a tool to tune acquisition parameters ensuring improved reconstruction of the underlying protein complex. We illustrate the challenges faced by practitioners in applying SMLM algorithms on real world data markedly different from the data used in development and show how ERGO can be run on new datasets without retraining while motivating the need for robust transfer learning in SMLM.","tags":["deep learning","super resolution microscopy","medical image analysis","long short term memory networks"],"title":"ERGO: Efficient Recurrent Graph Optimized Emitter Density Estimation in Single Molecule Localization Microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558346400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558346400,"objectID":"b069a4e3ee800a11c021273872e8a72d","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/talk/mmgan-ubc/","publishdate":"2019-05-20T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mmgan-ubc/","section":"talk","summary":"Invited to present my research in which we proposed a multi-input, multi-output generative adversarial network (GAN) called MM-GAN as a poster presentation.","tags":["deep learning","generative adversarial networks","medical imaging","mri","invited"],"title":"[Invited Talk] MM-GAN: Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network for Missing MRI Pulse Sequence Synthesis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma","Ghassan Hamarneh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556724600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556724600,"objectID":"7ad35c4203bedf6f3a6c44d50de03597","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/talk/mmgan-vin/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T15:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mmgan-vin/","section":"talk","summary":"Invited to present my research in which we proposed a multi-input, multi-output generative adversarial network (GAN) called MM-GAN.","tags":["deep learning","generative adversarial networks","medical imaging","mri","invited"],"title":"[Invited Talk] Missing MRI Pulse Sequence Synthesis using Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556206200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556206200,"objectID":"008c8f05f3e0722e43028a8cf19f6f87","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/talk/outlier-iclr2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-25T15:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/outlier-iclr2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented an interesting paper from ICLR 2019 that performs out-of-distribution sample detection using a simple framework.","tags":["deep learning","computer vision","classification"],"title":"[Paper Presentation] Deep Anomaly Detection with Outlier Exposure","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542726000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542726000,"objectID":"e368ded84774369902f4eaf1f74ad3d9","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/talk/nlp-structural-modelling/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/nlp-structural-modelling/","section":"talk","summary":"Presenting a highly scientific paper in a way that high school students can understand.

The CADe system considers MRI data consisting of four sequences (T1, T1c, T2, and T2FLAIR) as input, and automatically generates the bounding boxes encompassing the tumor regions in each slice which is deemed abnormal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CADe system, when used as a preliminary step before segmentation, can allow improved delineation of tumor region while reducing false positives arising in normal areas of the brain.

They equip encoder-decoder-like networks with richer feature representations, but at the cost of higher memory usage, computation, and possibly resulting in transferring non-discriminative feature maps. In this paper, we focus on improving skip connections used in segmentation networks (e.g., U-Net, V-Net, and The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu (DensNet) architectures). We propose light, learnable skip connections which learn to first select the most discriminative channels and then attend to the most discriminative regions of the selected feature maps. The output of the proposed skip connections is a unique feature map which not only reduces the memory usage and network parameters to a high extent, but also improves segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method on three different 2D and volumetric datasets and demonstrate that the proposed light, learnable skip connections can outperform the traditional heavy skip connections in terms of segmentation accuracy, memory usage, and number of network parameters.","tags":["convolutional neural networks","deep learning","medical image analysis","computer vision"],"title":"Select, Attend, and Transfer: Light, Learnable Skip Connections","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Reinforcement learning (RL) have recently become the framework of choice to develop intelligent agents that can control various entities inside an environment through learning by trial and error. One such task where RL algorithms have been applied is to control simulated robots in a physics-based environment to achieve a set specific goal. These goals can be to run, walk, hop, grasp objects and so on depending on the environment. Recently due to a surge in deep learning (DL) research, RL algorithms have underwent a transformation where many algorithms were revived by utilizing DL methods in some of the internal workings of the RL algorithms. This class of algorithms were named as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this project we compare three different DRL algorithms with respect to their ability to control a simulated physics-based robot in an environment. More specifically, we compare Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG) or REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms in three different physics-based locomotion environments HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, and Walker2d-v2 defined in MuJoCo framework ordered by increasing difficulty. Through our experiments, we found the PPO exhibited better performance in all environments in terms of the total reward gained in an episode. VPG performed worse than PPO but better than TRPO due to its simplistic policy gradient approach, though the high variance in training process due to reliance on absolute episode rewards was evident from the experiments. We also observed the TRPO\u0026rsquo;s convergence is inherently highly predictable, stable, and mostly monotonically increasing, leading to good convergence guarantees but with increased training time.\n","date":1523232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523232000,"objectID":"f703b060081974bb162b96cc026712e2","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/project/animation-rl-project/","publishdate":"2018-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/animation-rl-project/","section":"project","summary":"Comparison of various state-of-art reinforcement learning algorithms","tags":["deep learning","reinforcement learning","computer animation","physics-based locomotion"],"title":"Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Learning Control Policies for Physics-based Locomotion Tasks","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521558000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521558000,"objectID":"f7fcfc08a109047820ec84c45e61d10e","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/talk/simbicon-genbicon/","publishdate":"2018-03-20T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/simbicon-genbicon/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented two seminal models of physics-based walking, called SIMBICON and GENBICON.

We propose a method for verifying the signatory's identity by using Zernike Moments as global shape descriptors. Zernike Moments are image moments that are rotation invariant. The moments are also orthogonal on a unit circle which ensures minimum redundancy between the features representing the object shape. The features extracted in our approach have a relatively low dimensionality as compared to other studies, while retaining high representation power of the moments. Moreover, the module developed using our approach was able to demonstrate high performance coupled with low computation times in testing phase, making it suitable for real time applications.

With a set of four features, the method achieves the best area under the receiver characteristic curve of 0.95 and an accuracy of 89.89% using an artificial neural network for 270 randomly selected images from the DDSM database.\n","date":1444003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444003200,"objectID":"5d46ad87e13eeb320707d4733c234453","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/project/mammogram-project/","publishdate":"2015-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mammogram-project/","section":"project","summary":"Propose a new feature extraction and selection method using NSGA-II for classifying masses as benign or malignant.","tags":["machine learning","medical image analysis","artificial neural networks","svm","computer vision","optimization"],"title":"Automatic Characterization of Breast Masses using NSGA-II based Feature Selection","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anmol Sharma","Jagroop Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1387411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387411200,"objectID":"5fdf57b5f5fb4180cb2c3fe395b1a41c","permalink":"https://trane293.github.io/publication/image-conference/","publishdate":"2013-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/image-conference/","section":"publication","summary":"Image denoising is the first preprocessing step dealing with image processing. In image denoising an image is processed using certain restoration techniques to remove induced noise which may creep in the image during acquisition, transmission or compression process. Examples of noise in an image can be Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Impulse Noise, etc. The goal of restoration techniques is to obtain an image that is as close to the original input image as possible. In this paper objective evaluation methods are used to judge the efficiency of different types of spatial domain filters applied to different noise models, with a quantitative approach. Performance of each filter is compared as they are applied on images affected by a wide variety of noise models. Conclusions are drawn in the end, about which filter is best suited for a number of noise models individually induced in an image, according to the experimental data obtained.","tags":["image processing","spatial filtering"],"title":"Image Denoising using Spatial Domain Filters: A Quantitative Study","type":"publication"}]
